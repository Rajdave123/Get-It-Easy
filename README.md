# Get-It-Easy
"Get It Easy" is an online auction website aimed at taking the auction to the fingertips of aspiring bidders by opening up the doors of the "OPEN Auction House' to a wider cross section of Art Lovers and Antique Collectors. This site also acts as an open forum where buyers and sellers can come together and exchange their products. The site makes sure that the sellers get a fair deal and buyers get a genuine product.

Proposed System
Home Page - The site opens up the door to aspiring web users through the Home page. The Home page is designed in such a way that the layout is as user friendly as possible. There is a navigational menu at the top of the page which links to various inner pages. There is a category drop down on the left side for easy manipulation. The center area is for displaying latest products
Login/User Registration - Those who wish to take part in bidding or sell products at the site have to register at the site as seller or buyer. Only authenticated users can take part in selling or in bidding. The system automatically rejects un-authenticated users who try to bid or sell at the site.
Register Products - This module is for presenting items for bidding. Only those who have registered and authenticated as sellers can place their articles for bidding. The Module collects information like Product Name, Product Details, Starting Bid amount, Closing date etc. The system automatically inputs the closing date.(24 hrs)
Bidding Module - The module is for bidding on any selected item. The bidder has to authenticate before participating in the bidding. The system checks whether the incremental amount entered by the bidder is equal or more than the incremental minimum set during the product registration time. The system places the record in the bid history against the bidder's account.
My Auction - This page is an interface for both buyer and seller. Buyer can see the profile of the bidding history of items which are still open on which he/she has already bid. Similarly, the seller can see the progress of bidding on articles he/she has placed for bidding.
WebAdmin - This link opens to the administration module which is open to web administrator only. Here site administrator can add product categories and can edit product information like closing date. Also there is an option for administering the closed bids. This module is for contacting the bidder and seller by email instructing them to settle the transaction within a time frame.
